# Clash-Of-Clans

## Goal
You play the Barbarian King who is raiding a village. Once every building has been destroyed, you win the game. You can summon barbarians to help you win this battle from any of the three spawn points in the village. The cannons will try and destroy all of your troops. If they are sucessful in doing so, you lose.

## Bonus
The King can use a special power called the Leviathan Axe that damages allt troops within a certain radius. This damage is also applied across walls. This is also your best line of defence against the Witch.

If you destroy the townhall, a trap is triggered and a cage surrounds you. The witch awakens, and destroys weak troops such as barbarians. In an epic battle between the Barbarian King and the Witch, if you emerge victorious, you win the game, provided all the other buildings are also destroyed.
